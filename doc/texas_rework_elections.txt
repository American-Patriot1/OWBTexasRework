This is a document about handling NCR elections. It was scripted by @CGS, any questions/issues go to him

In elections each candidate and state gets an ID:
States' IDs:
	Boneyard -- 1
	Dayglow -- 2
	Maxon -- 3
	Redding -- 4
	Shady Sands -- 5

Candidates' IDs
	Allgood -- 1
	Kimbal -- 2
	Hayes -- 3
	Secret boi -- 4

To start elections you just need to set up variable `global.first_candidate_id` and `global.second_candidate_id`

Unlock elections window:
	Still WIP, use debug decisions

To add support use `ncr_elections_add_support_effect` effect:
	To use this effect you need to set up state ID and candidate's ID and support to add, use the following temp vars: state_id, candidate_id, support_to_add (must be positive)
	Take not of the constants on top of the file with this effect, they allow to adjust how elections will function

ncr_elections_remove_support_both_effect removes support in state from both canidates
ncr_elections_remove_support_effect removes support from one candidate

To get the winner, run `calculate_ncr_election_winner_trigger` trigger, it will give result in ncr_elections_winner_id_temp variable:
	Example of usage:
completion_effect = {
	if = {
		limit = {
			calculate_ncr_election_winner_trigger = yes
			check_variable = { calculate_ncr_election_winner_trigger = -1 }
		}
		civil_war_go_brrr_effect = yes
	}
}

Alternatively, use `calculate_ncr_elections_winner_effect` effect, which sets constant variable ncr_elections_winner_id to the winner. -1, if there is no winner


To make elections visible in dropdown, add `ncr_elections_gui_allowed_flag` flag to NCR. If you want to block access to the GUI, clear this flag.
